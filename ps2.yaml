    dies in an accident during mountain climbing. But because of the

    memories of high-school when you were in third year and play until the day
    of your accident. Second part start with Yuuichi waking up in a hospital.
    But not is his own body, but rather in that of whomever you made heroine in
    the first part of the story. Your soul is sort-of possessing that person's
    body. You want to tell people you know that you are still alive somehow, but
    because you are not really you, it appears to be rather difficult feat to
    achieve. But it is a matter of time when the soul decides to merge, and
    because two souls cannot forever occupy the same body, the one that doesn't
    merge will disappear, and if Yuuichi's soul merges, he will continue to live
    on in this body.

    which, through the power of Songs, can converse with the world and cast
    powerful magic. However, in order to cast more powerful magic, they have to
    take a harmful material called Grathnode into their bodies, through an act
    called Install. Since the Install is a very painful experience for the
    Reyvateils, they only let people that they really trust to do it. The story
    centers on Lyner Barsett, an eighteen-year-old whose father governs Platina,
    a town located in the top floors of the tower. Lyner is uninterested in
    politics, and instead seeks adventure in the army. However, when a strange
    virus appears and they can't defeat it, Lyner is assigned the task to go
    down to the floating continent and retrieve a mystical artifact to defeat
    the virus.

  description: Beatmania IIDX 9th Style is the ninth game in the beatmania IIDX
    series of music video games. It was released in arcades by Konami in 2003.
    The game features over 50 new songs, some of which can be unlocked using
    Konami's e-Amusement platform - which made its official debut on 9th Style.
    The interface used by 9th Style is more modern and crisper looking than
    previous styles, taking advantage of the better graphics capabilities of the
    new PC based hardware which 9th Style now utilizes. The new hardware also
    eliminates the separate DVD player which was used on previous versions for
    background videos, as all the videos and data are now stored on the hard
    drive contained within the machine.

    fantasy-based, it is distinct from the original game. It is divided into
    three realms - heaven, home to white-winged angels; the human world,
    inhabited by relatively weak, wingless people; and hell, where black-winged
    devils reside. The three realms are largely independent and their natives
    are suspicious of the other realms. Many humans have been convinced of the
    evil nature of Hell by the angels, but for all their fearsome powers neither
    the devils nor Hell itself are inherently malevolent. Hell is ruled by the
    beautiful and compassionate Jenarose, who is said to love humankind more
    than anyone in the world.

    and without these Buzz! Buzzers and there are four buzzers per set. This
    means that using the PS2’s two USB connections, up to eight players can play
    at once. The game was developed in partnership with the Department for
    Education and Skills and expert educational consultancy Schoolzone for use
    in both classrooms and at home. As with all Buzz! Games, it’s set in a game
    show environment. Players answer questions on different subjects taken from
    the Key Stage 2 National Curriculum, aimed at children from age’s seven to
    eleven. There are several game play modes available, allowing players to
    play on just one subject or from a wide range. Team and single player modes
    are also available to allow different numbers of players to play at once. A
    Teacher feature gives the teacher control over how the game is played,
    allowing them to pause and involve children in the answers being given.

    Crash's arch nemeses Neo and Nina Cortex to mutate the local creatures into
    titanic abominations. Using Crash's legendary mix of outrageous antics and
    daredevil bravado, players "hijack" enemies to take control of their action
    and use their fearsome powers against all manner of enemies. "Jack to
    Attack!" - Control, play and battle as 15 enemies, including titanic
    creatures such as Scorporilla, Ratcicle, Magamadon and Shellephant. While in
    control of a monster players can throw toxic stink bombs, call lightning
    down from the sky, fire lasers beams from their eyes or even impale enemies
    with a massive scorpion tail - use all of the creatures' special abilities
    to defeat Neo and Nina Cortex. Crash now has a powerful acrobatic fighting
    system that includes punches and flying kicks, multiple attacks and special
    counter moves. Players can power-up skills to unlock new attacks and blazing
    combos. Crash can now interact with his world in totally new ways. Players
    can wall-run, swing from ropes and flip off springboards - Crash can even
    toss Aku Aku on the ground to surf, skate, grind and shred. At any point in
    the game, a second player can join in the fun and play as Carbon-Crash to
    help unleash total chaos. In a totally innovative twist to co-op action
    gaming, Crash can even jack Carbon-Crash (or vice versa) for some hysterical
    Crash "jacked"-Crash mayhem.

    running around, the chickens feature a lot of animated motion sequences that
    make them seem almost alive. The surroundings are completely generated in 3D
    and feature a lot of crazy objects and scenes such as two hedgehogs playing
    cards (one is actually wearing dark sunglasses!). The chickens try to hide
    in every conceivable place on screen, be it an old oven or in an outdoor
    toilet. They hide in wheat fields and even dress up as a sunflower in order
    to escape the player's dreadful gun. All these features make it more
    difficult for the player to get all the chickens. The actual shooting
    controls remain the same as in previous Moorhuhn games: the player aims with
    the controller, shoots by with the X button and reloads with the O button."

    only the beginning.  Taking place two years after the events of the original
    Crimson Sea, CRIMSON SEA 2 sees the IAG - the agency charged with the
    protection of the galaxy -in a state of near-collapse. Still reeling from a
    massive surprise attack, IAG Commander, Live-D organizes the remaining
    forces along with a rag-tag team of mercenaries and survivors. Sho's old
    friends from G-Squad are dispersed to different areas of the galaxy, but in
    light of the devastation, Sho searches for more help.   CRIMSON SEA 2
    features over 60 missions and 3 two-player modes. Work together to bring
    down the enemy and clear a stage in "Co-op" mode, battle head-to-head "death
    match" style in "Versus" mode, or try to outscore your human opponent in
    "Competition" mode.

  description: 'It is the end of the 19th century, and the Millennium Earl has
    spent thousands of years building an army of loyal creatures known as Akuma.
    There is a select group of people that stop the Earl from carrying out his
    plans of mass destruction; these people are the Exorcists, chosen by God
    through crystals referred to as Innocence, and their job is to destroy the
    Akuma. The story of D.Gray-man: Sōsha no Shikaku focuses on five young
    exorcists who serve as members of the Black Order, operating under the
    Vatican and the Pope: Allen Walker from Great Britain, whose left arm can
    transform into an enormous claw called Crown Clown and whose cursed left eye
    allows him to see the souls of Akuma; Lenalee Lee from China, whose Dark
    Boots grant her extraordinary agility; Yu Kanda from Japan, wielding his
    sword, Mugen, in combat; Lavi, a cheerful young adult training to become one
    who records the history of the world around him, wielding a hammer called
    Tettsui that can modify its size; and Arystar Krory III of Romania, a
    "vampire" who sucks the blood of Akuma in order to obtain superhuman
    strength.'

    game for up to four players based on the Japanese roleplaying franchise,
    Dokapon. Gameplay mixes traditional board game style movement with
    turn-based RPG battles. Players spin roulettes, then move according to the
    number they get. If a player lands on a monster field, he has to battle
    enemies via the game's turn-based RPG battle system. Players can use four
    different special skills during the fights, which are mapped to the four
    face buttons for easy access. As they progress through the quest, players
    can change jobs from a poll of 45 different occupations. Characters are
    presented in a unique paper cutout style, with thick white frames around the
    outline. Two primary modes of play are included: a single player mode in
    which you work through a story as one particular character and a multiplayer
    mode playable by up to four players simultaneously."

  description: In Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires, the armies of the kingdom are at
    your command. The player's ultimate goal is to conquer the 25 regions of
    Ancient China and build an entire Empire using cunning diplomacy and
    uncompromising force. Before each battle, the player will meet with the war
    council to decide upon military and political policies for the kingdom, then
    it's time for war. The game gives armchair generals total control of their
    kingdom. Now, gamers can issue direct orders to each officer or signal
    general commands to officers on the field. Players will order when the army
    will take the offensive, defend their ground, or have all officers gather
    for an ambush. Gamers can also choose the officers for an attack force,
    entice captives into joining the kingdom's service and even expel officers
    from the kingdom. There's even greater authority over Government, Product
    Development, Diplomacy and Battle Tactics with the game's 25 new policies
    for a total of 75 in all. The game's imperial-sized action includes 4
    scenarios to unlock, 2-Player Co-Op play in "Empire" and "Free" modes, new
    items to unlock, and control of over 200 officers! Once the dust has
    settled, there's the real history of Ancient China to discover in the game's
    detailed Encyclopedia.

  description: "In the future, rebel space colonies launch a brutal war of
    independence with a series of coordinated orbital strikes against Earth. The
    chaotic assault signals the dawn of a new age of combat and the ultimate
    instrument of warfare is born, the Mobile Suit. Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2
    combines the devastating power of the Mobile Suit, the rich legacy of the
    Gundam universe and the furious Tactical Action game play of the Dynasty
    Warriors series. The game thrusts players into incredible battles against
    legions of enemy Mobile Suits on distant planetary surfaces and in the far
    reaches of outer space. For the first time, Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2 lets
    players engage in melee battles against colossal enemies such as the Psycho
    Gundam. The massive Psycho Gundam can quickly reconfigure their bodies into
    titanic mobile fortresses which can move with remarkable speed. However,
    highly-trained pilots can utilize their own Mobile Suit's speed, agility,
    and of course firepower to defeat these deadly juggernauts. Dynasty
    Warriors: Gundam 2 also includes new stories featuring mecha from the latest
    Gundam anime, plus mecha from Char's Counter Attack and more. With mecha
    parts collected throughout the course of the game, players can adapt a
    Mobile Suit which can be piloted into combat."

  description: "Energy Airforce: aimStrike! is a PlayStation 2 game that focuses
    strictly on being an authentic flight simulator. All aircraft and weapons
    used in the game are either existing or prototypes used by the U.S.
    military. Realistic loads of weapons and fuel (although chaff and flares are
    unlimited) can be viewed from outside or from a realistic cockpit view. When
    flying the aircraft in cockpit view, the pilot's leg can be seen depressing
    appropriately.<br /><br />The game follows a generic storyline and could be
    considered to be a parody of the Gulf War of 1991. A small sandy desert
    country (whose capital is \"Ad Barath\") has a military coup d'état (hinting
    to the Ba'ath Party) and gives birth to a militarized dictatorship. The
    country then uses its air superiority to invade a peaceful neighbor to the
    south (which denotes Kuwait). At this point, the player's organization steps
    in to combat the dictatorship and restore freedom to the besieged country."

    Wisdom with his girlfriend, Eliel Evergrand, also a co-worker taking part in
    the development of Legacy. Their escape attempt ends in failure.  Eliel's
    soul is then forced into the core of the most powerful Legacy ever made,

    2. With more than 5,000 fully destructible objects on every track as well as

    is taken to unprecedented heights. With a greater emphasis placed on causing

    trash the local scenery, litter the track with obstacles, while at the same

    first. The ever-popular Ragdoll mini-games from the original FlatOut game
    make a welcome return and are better than ever with 12 Ragdoll events, a
    Ragdoll Championship and full online support. New Ragdoll events include
    basketball, baseball and royal flush cards.

    environment and its obstacles, urban or natural, as a series of challenges
    to be overcome. To the Traceurs, parkour has a philosophical appeal: they
    feel transformed by the experience, free from the grind of city life. Since
    its inception in Paris during the mid-1980s, it has spread across the globe
    and now has an international army of exponents and enthusiasts. In Free
    Running, the concrete jungle becomes your urban playground as you run,
    vault, jump or climb over obstacles in the most fluid and flowing manner
    possible. Test the boundaries of human ability as you perform death-defying
    leaps and jaw-dropping trips across inner-city rooftops. To be crowned King
    of Parkour, you must master over 50 moves, tricks and stunts including 'Kong
    Vaults', 'Pharaoh Climbs', 'Rail Split Vaults' and 'Vertical Wall Runs' in a
    variety of game modes while racing against human or computer-controlled
    competitors."

    novel aspect. Much of the incidental music from the original is repurposed
    here, and the sequel also keeps to the original's style of anime-style
    artwork superimposed into actual photographic backgrounds of real-life
    locations.

    investigates from a personal computer every day has become everyday. One
    day, a child sleeping in the park is attacked by thugs. Kitaro, who noticed
    that the feathers of the falcons had fallen on the spot coincided with the
    mass abduction of babies a week ago, rushed to the hospital where the
    abduction occurred. This was the beginning of a major incident involving
    yokais across Japan.

  description: David Goldman, intrepid newspaper photographer extraordinaire, goes
    on assignment to capture wild and wacky events on film. Under seemingly
    normal circumstances which can quickly get out of hand, David clicks and
    snaps opportune and interesting shots which will please his chief editor and
    ensure his continued employment at the Times. David's aspiration since
    childhood has been the snaring of a Pulitzer and the Japanese assignment
    dovetails neatly with his dream. The first level plants our maniacally
    grinning friend on a Japanese street where citizens coalesce and dawdle. The
    people eventually start hamming it up, ignite incidents and essentially open
    themselves up for blooper-magnitude photo ops. A limited amount of film
    requires a game plan of paucity when taking photos, limiting yourself to
    only the money shots. Later levels find David in a forest filled with
    spirits, a sports arena, a zoo and a shopping center, among others. The game
    touts support of the Popegg camera once it's released and players may take a
    photo of themselves and paste their face on in-game characters if so
    inclined.

    valuables, and even people who got lost. Now they are offered a huge sum of
    money for a recovery job they have to do for a mysterious customer from an
    even more mysterious Castle of Infinity. The gameplay is based on
    exploration of randomly generated dungeons. You search for items and also
    trigger important cut scenes by exploring every corner in the dungeons. The
    action-based combat resembles a fighting game. You can perform a variety of
    moves, block your opponent's attack, and switch between the characters.
    Attacks deplete your stamina bar, so continuously using the strongest
    attacks is not always the best choice. When your stamina bar is full, you
    can perform powerful combo attacks."

  description: With great power comes great responsibility. Play as a drifter
    bestowed with supernatural-like abilities who must confront the fate and
    responsibilities inherent with this new found power. Hand-to-hand combat is
    at its best when gamers unleash the power of the God Hand to deliver
    righteous punishment onto worthy enemies. Centuries ago, the world was in
    imminent doom until a man defeated Angra and sealed away his godly powers
    into his own arms. People feared and revered this person who would become
    known as "God Hand". Legend has it that anyone who acquired such hands would
    possess immense power that could turn them into a deity or demon. Fast
    forward to a small town overrun with thugs wielding super-human strength. A
    gruff drifter named Jean finds his way to this troubled region and defends a
    woman surrounded by a brutal mob. Despite his valiant efforts, Gene is
    overpowered by these thugs and his right arm is severed before falling into
    unconsciousness. He later awakens to find his limb whole again and that he
    is now the possessor of the legendary God Hand. The burden of being hunted
    by demonic legions seeking the right hand of God soon begins.

  description: God of War saw Kratos, a mortal warrior, set upon an epic quest to
    dethrone a God. But his journey did not end there. In God of War II, Kratos
    sits atop his Olympus throne, as the new God of War - far more ruthless than
    Ares ever was. To end his continued torment, Kratos must journey to the far
    reaches of the earth and defeat untold horrors and alter that which no
    mortal, or god has ever changed, his fate. God of War II sets an epic stage
    for a devastating mythological war to end all wars. In God of War II,
    players retake the role of Kratos. Armed with the deadly blades and
    blistering rage, players are aided by new breath-taking magic and new brutal
    combat moves. The journey takes them through vividly striking environments
    where they are faced with a labyrinth of challenging puzzles and mini-games
    intricately woven into the story. The violent world of Greek mythology comes
    to life in gory detail as Kratos encounters new mythical characters, and
    compete in epic boss battles in his quest.

    everything. Once a trusted wise guy in the Leone crime family, Toni Cipriani

    for things to be put right.   The streets of Liberty City are in turmoil.
    Warring mafiosi vie for control as the town begins to self-destruct under
    waves of political corruption, organized crime, drug trafficking and union
    strikes. No one can be trusted as Toni tries to clean up the mess of the
    city's chaotic underworld. Deranged hit men, morally depraved tycoons,

    bring the city under Leone control.  Forced to fight for his life in an
    odyssey that will shake Liberty City to its foundations, Toni must use any
    means necessary to secure his place in the leadership of the Leone family in
    a town up for grabs.

  description: "Growlanswer Generations is a spellbinding set of two complete RPGs
    (Role Playing Games) that span space and time itself. Growlanswer: The Sense
    of Justice introduces players to Growlanser's world of swordplay and magic,
    where peace between three kingdoms is on the verge of shattering.
    Growlanser: The Dual Darkness takes players back to the place, time, and
    planet where the series began. In both games, players control the hero, and
    four to seven of his companions in ever more massive, strategic battles
    against the enemy forces in a variety of scenarios. Customizable characters
    with upgradeable magic, skills and power rings, as well as multiple story
    branches make Growlanser Generations one of the most flexible Strategy/RPGs
    to date. Developed by Atlus and CareerSoft, the Growlanser saga is an epic
    fantasy tale featuring a unique mix of strategic, menu-driven combat and
    real-time character movement and fighting. Its sublime combination of action
    and strategy was crafted by the key team members responsible for the
    long-running hit series Langrisser in japan. A deep story with over 80 hours
    of gameplay, more than ten solid hours of voice work, and fantastic
    character designs by anime artist Satoshi Urushihara compliment the gameplay
    and will keep players glued to the screen."

    different costume, and moveset.

    Hero: World Tour, with band career modes for single or multiple players with
    a storyline drawn as a cartoon, competitive modes online, and the
    possibility to play with different instruments such as a regular guitar, a
    bass guitar, drums, and doing the vocals. The storyline describes how a band
    wants to follow in the footsteps of the Metallica and become a leading act
    on their tour. This edition adds an Expert+ difficulty mode where players
    need to drum using a second bass pedal to mimic the playing style of Lars
    Ulrich, the drummer of the band. The members also did motion capture
    sessions for the avatars in the game.  The music selection consists of 28
    master recordings and 21 additional songs by others selected by the band.
    Bonus features include various videos and trivia about the songs. Progress
    is made by completing sets of songs, rather than a series of gigs as in
    Guitar Hero: World Tour, set in venues that were in important in the band's
    career. Performances are rated with stars and a certain amount is needed to
    progress and unlock a new set. The game also includes the GHTunes from World
    Tour where new songs can be created and shared. A new Drum Mode offers the
    possibility to play the drums without an existing drum track to create new
    rhythms, and the Battle mode (from Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock), has
    been updated with Metallica influences for the power-ups, with names like
    Fade To Black, Under The Ice and Ride The Lightning."

    splintered into numerous unstable factions, only the powerful Western
    Alliance can bring peace and stability once more. With an arsenal of
    powerful AWGS-class infiltration units at their disposal, these
    battle-hardened warriors have what it takes to rip off a quick CHM round and
    skeetch the less-skilled predatory scum of the New World Order. These
    hard-earned skills will be put to the ultimate test in six intense world
    theatres of operation with you in the vanguard position. That's right.
    You've been summoned to join this elite class of peacemakers. So put on a
    brave face and suck in that gut -- you've got a world to save.

    - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
  description: In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Voldemort is tightening
    his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer
    the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within
    the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final
    battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key
    to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old
    friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant
    Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information.
    Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as
    teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more
    drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that
    Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's
    chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealously but
    determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student
    remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is
    in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.
    In the game, players will return to Hogwarts to help Harry survive a fraught
    sixth year. They will also have a chance to engage in exciting wizard duels,
    mix and brew magical ingredients in Potions class and take to the air to
    lead the Gryffindor Quidditch team to victory. Players may even get
    sidetracked by Ron's romantic entanglements as they journey towards a
    dramatic climax and discover the identity of the Half-Blood Prince.

    degradation, and dishonor.  Your contracts will take you to exotic locations
    around the globe including Sicily, St. Petersburg, Japan, Malaysia, and
    India.  A diverse arsenal of equipment, from armor-piercing rifles and
    explosives to chloroform and poison darts, are at your disposal.  Stalk and
    eliminate your targets up close and personal, in either first- or
    third-person perspectives.  You must decide whether to use stealth or
    aggression, but be careful--you'll have to deal with the consequences.

  description: "When assassins from Agent 47's contract agency, The ICA, are
    systematically eliminated in a series of hits, it seems a larger, more
    powerful agency has entered the fray. For Agent 47 it's business as usual,
    until suddenly he loses contact with The ICA. Sensing that he may be the
    next target, he travels to America, where he prepares to make a killing.
    Agent 47 is back and this time he's paid in cold, hard cash. How the money
    is spent will affect his passage through the game and the weapons at his
    disposal, resulting in a unique gameplay experience for each player. Powered
    by a new version of Io's stunning Glacier engine, Hitman: Blood Money
    delivers the most brutal and realistic simulation of life as the world's
    deadliest assassin."

    shooting stages. You can make your samurai shoot, use a screen-clearing bomb
    and perform a slash with his sword. The slash move forms the core of
    Homura's gameplay, as by slashing enemy bullets, you can send them back at
    the enemy. Homura features multi-form bosses and four stages of play, with
    stages one through three branching off into multiple paths. The game is
    based on an arcade title.

    to the floor to slap arrows with their hands. Another major difference
    between IN THE GROOVE and DDR is the arrows. Here, they are fully polygonal,
    meaning the arrows can spin around, bounce up and down, look like they're
    vanishing into the background, and other tricks that challenge the player.
    Another addition is the mine arrow. Stepping or slapping one of these will
    cause the arrow to explode and break the combo chain the player was building
    up. Fortunately, the game includes a large variety of difficulty settings
    (13 different difficulty levels in all), so even beginners can get into the
    dancing action. The game play modes include all of the standard ones gamers
    have come to expect in a dancing game: arcade mode, two-player challenge
    mode, workout mode, and never-ending modes are all available for players to
    enjoy. The song list is fairly large as well with over 70 titles. For dance
    fans that have mastered everything on the market, IN THE GROOVE kicks up the
    difficulty and will make gamers rethink their entire approach to dancing
    games as they learn to use their hands and feet together."

    with his nemesis, Magnus Voller, in a race for a relic of biblical
    proportions - the Staff of Moses. Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings

    Ark, the mine-cart scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and the

    tradition of sorry-looking mini-golf courses, the game is set in a
    dilapidated theme-park which takes decaying kitsch to new extremes.

  description: Sora, Donald and Goofy travel down a long road that meanders
    through endless fields, and come to a crossroads. As Sora stands in the
    crossroads, he gazes up at the night sky and thinks of his lost friends.
    Just then, a mysterious man approaches from down one of the branching paths.
    "Ahead lies something you need," he says, "but to claim it, you must lose
    something dear." The man vanishes before a single path, leading to a castle
    that eerily resembles a girl's drawing... In the coming journey, what will
    Sora and his companions gain, and what will they lose? In addition to Sora,
    players can control Riku in this adventure that bridges the gap between
    [[Kingdom Hearts]] and [[Kingdom Hearts II]] A full 3D remake of the
    original GBA release, ''Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories'' offers a
    refreshing rendition of the hit title for the PlayStation 2 system. The
    talented voice cast from the North American releases of ''Kingdom Hearts''
    and ''Kingdom Hearts II'', including David Gallagher and Haley Joel Osment,
    return to breathe new life into the beloved characters. The mini-game
    catalog has been completely renewed, now with four brand new experiences

    Pucelle, a demon hunting squad. Features Dark Portals and Purification:
    Brand new to the RPG world, use your powers to purify defiled ground and

    items in real time. Fast leveling system: Items, characters and skills can
    increase every round of battle for well earned instant gratification. Carry
    up to 149 items and use them to learn special magic. Turn enemies to allies.
    Bring up to 8 units into battle. Seize the high ground! Battlefield terrain
    will vary in height: attacking down is way better than being attacked from

    Von Croy, Lara becomes a fugitive on the run. Pursued by the police, she
    follows the Alchemist into a dark world of blood, betrayal and vengeance
    where it is up to her to defeat this unholy alliance, and stop them from
    unleashing their incredible powers on the world. For the first time in a
    Tomb Raider game, Lara has the ability to talk to characters, and the
    choices you make in conversation will affect Lara's route through the game.

  description: "A year-long global war between the World Alliance and the World
    Order Reorganization Front has ended with planet Earth in peril. As a result
    of resentment and distrust, the World Alliance has begun to split, and the
    seeds for a new global war are being planted. In the midst of this epic war,
    Lethal Skies II puts you in command of an Air Force, including 19 of the
    world's most devastating fighter planes. Through 20 missions, you'll be able
    to switch control to other vehicles such as jets, tanks, battle mechs, and
    submarines, and you can even switch roles and become the enemy.<br />Lethal
    Skies II (Sidewinder V) is a combat flight simulator set in an eco-disaster
    torn near-future with more realistic loadouts and physics modeling than the
    eminent Ace Combat series by [[Namco|Namco-Bandai Games]]. Released on
    September 9, 2003 in North America, it marks the third and last Western
    installment in the series (fifth and last in Japan) after Bogey Dead 6 on
    the PlayStation and Lethal Skies Team SW: Elite Pilot on the PlayStation 2.
    The major features touted for this release were its ability to use the
    i.LINK 2-player mode, along with local 2-player and the addition of more
    cinematic camera modes. 19 flyable aircraft over 20 missions (with an
    unlockable enemy-side campaign) mark the end of the series."

    Lilie hopes to build an alchemy academy in the Kingdom. Alchemy is severely
    under developed in comparison to the Kingdom of El Baldor, which is home to
    many talented alchemists. Because Salburg has never seen the likes of
    alchemy, Lilie must prove to King Schigsal that the Kingdom would benefit
    from alchemy. Working through a small workshop in town, Lilie will enlist
    the help of two bright alchemy students from El Bador, Hermina and Ingrid,
    to help her work. Lilie's main goal is to gather any aide that she can so
    that the academy can be built."

    baserunning delivers both an exciting presentation style and an intuitive
    method to precisely control runners. The new baserunning mechanic utilizes
    the right analog thumbstick to choose how baserunners slide -- head or feet
    first -- in conjunction with hook sliding left or right of the base. Players
    will be able to reach a base quicker, get up more quickly from a slide, or
    avoid being tagged out with the new freedom found in Maximum Sliding.
    Baseburner Mode allows the gamer to play any 'at-bat' through the
    perspective of any baserunner, delivering precision control to gamers.

  description: Hidden in a forest in Europe sits an old castle that has stood
    there for over 1000 years and inside this castle lays a magic school. Both
    wizards and monster hunters in training attend this institution. In the
    previous installments you’re either playing as these very monster hunters
    and spell casters, or attending magic school like the current game. In this
    game you play as a son of a well established Crichton family. However,
    despite your potent lineage you’re aptitude has been measured to be one of
    the lowest possible. Regardless, you’re still admitted to the school (along
    with two friends who’re twin-sisters). Suddenly on the way to the school,
    the train you all were riding suddenly becomes derailed. It is night and
    monsters lurk--will the batch of new students get to the castle safe and
    sound?

    game set in a massive, highly reactive, war-torn world. A power-hungry
    tyrant messes with Venezuela's oil supply, sparking an invasion that turns
    the country into a warzone. But for you, international crisis is all upside:
    You are a mercenary, and you profit from chaos. Mercenaries 2 features a
    slew of potential clients, all willing to pay you to do their dirty work.
    Dirty deeds, done for exorbitant fees. These are world powers with deep
    pockets, deep grudges, and enough arms and ammo to start World War III. This
    is your kind of environment. Mercenaries 2 features the latest and most
    dangerous in civilian and military tech, everything from shiny new sports
    cars, to the future-tech satellite-guided bunker-busting mini-nuke. Tanks,
    APCs, boats, luxury automobiles - you name it, you can have it delivered to
    you in real time. And if you run out of cash you can always 'acquire' the
    gear you need in the field. If you see it, you can buy it, steal it, or blow
    the living crap out of it. Play your own way, or play with the help of a
    friend in the new cooperative multiplayer mode. You are not a soldier. You
    don't have to play by anyone's rules. You have your own code: you will
    fulfill the terms of the contract, no matter what. Not everyone in the world
    of Mercenaries is as honorable. Everyone will try and screw you, given the
    chance. They think they can get away with it, because they don't know rule
    #1: EVERYBODY PAYS."

  description: In the not so distant future... Desperate to find a way to save the
    earth from pollution, mankind created a gigantic supercomputer and named it
    Noah. Noah's solution, however, was to exterminate its creators. In a matter
    of days, civilization fell to terrifying weapons and monsters created by
    Noah. This cataclysmic event came to be known as the Great Destruction. As
    the years passed, the number of human survivors grew, slowly but steadily.
    They formed villages and towns, living off of technology that they were able
    to salvage from the piles of wreckage. Among the survivors were those who
    rose up to fight Noah's robotic henchmen. To track down and eliminate these
    threats to humanity, they utilized the most powerful weapons still operable
    after the Great Destruction--tanks! As a sign of respect, people nicknamed
    them "hunters." Noah, the cause of the Great Destruction, was in fact
    destroyed by one such hunter. However, its ruthless offspring still roamed
    the world, striking fear in people's hearts. Now, a young man prepares to
    set foot into the deadly desert wasteland to make a name for himself, as did
    his father, a veteran hunter...

    with METAL SLUG 3D for the PS2. No longer a side scrolling game, the new
    third person perspective will give fans of the series a new look at the
    world of METAL SLUG. The core component of the game, however, is still the
    same: shoot everything that gets in the way. Now that it's 3D, gamers will
    have to worry about enemies sneaking up behind them, moving beside them, and
    dropping down from above. Fortunately, the game has a lock on system that
    instantly locks on to the closest enemy at the touch of a button. The
    familiar METAL SLUG characters have returns, including Marco. Players have
    four different characters they can select from, and there are many different
    weapons they can find and customize in the different levels. Extra ammo and
    health are also scattered about each level, and gamers will want to be sure
    to collect every one of them. For the first time ever, METAL SLUG goes 3D,
    and gamers won't want to miss this remarkable change to the series. METAL
    SLUG 3D takes the challenge and fun gameplay to a whole new level. "

    on the improvised tracks around the Micro Machines house, garden and - for

    rubber on the blazing hot cooker, turbo boost around the pool table (while
    avoiding the treacherous pockets), or hit the gas as you drive around the
    rim of the bath, carefully negotiating the ferocious waters pouring over the
    edge of the bath (because someone left the tap running).

  description: Easily the most ambitious NASCAR game to date on any platform,
    NASCAR 2001 has been designed from the ground up with completely original
    programming code that takes advantage of the power of the PlayStation 2.
    With the advanced power of the Emotion Engine, the designers for NASCAR 2001
    have been able to duplicate key driving points and strategies of some of the
    biggest names in the racing field. Gone are the days of one-dimensional AI,
    thanks to independent artificial intelligence routines geared towards each
    racer's personality--older drivers will wisely hold back until key moments,
    while the rookies and speed demons will be more prone to charging recklessly
    into turns. Thirty-five active drivers with their respective cars (complete
    with sponsors) are available to rip around 14 different tracks--including
    night races and (in a NASCAR game first) Daytona. Body deformation, particle
    effects (like smoke and fire), sparks, tire marks on the road, and wall
    marks ensure that it looks as good as it plays.

  description: Fast, furious, authentic NBA action!  989 Sports' long-running
    b-baller makes its debut on the PlayStation 2 with live presentation
    unmatched on the system. The players sport thousands of motion-captured
    moves, and over a hundred hours of play-by-play were logged in the
    production. Everything in the stadium is modeled as closely as possible,
    from the detailed players to the real coaches on the sidelines to the people
    in the stands. ShootOut also brings back the Create Dunk feature, and
    refines the game's Touch Shooting and Passing control. As always, your
    choice is going to be a tough one between LIVE and ShootOut, and in the 2k1
    basketball season, each has taken a shot at the game of basketball from a
    different angle. Check which fits your style. Authentic players, animations,
    and arenas make this game so realistic you'll need high tops and wrist bands
    to play. It's got a new and improved game engine, redesigned player
    controls, and a TV-style presentation that has been edited to include more
    camera angles, close-ups, zooms, and cut-aways. Team-specific playbooks have
    more than 450 plays designed with the NBA elite. With the enhancements made
    to the Match-Up & Deny, Read & React A.I., no artificial intelligence has
    ever been more savvy. This year the road to the NBA Finals begins and ends
    with an NBA ShootOut.

    from anywhere in the field or get your free-throw percentage up into the
    90s. Create Dunk has made the transition to next-generation gaming. Now you
    are able to choreograph your personal hops and aerobatics worthy of a dunk

  description: Take the ball and march. The orders are clear--you came to the game
    to win, so get it done. This is football, 100 yards fought inch for inch.
    After the triumph of Madden for the debut season for the PlayStation 2
    computer entertainment system, EA Sports is building its army of gridiron
    dominators with a full-on next-generation version of collegiate football in
    NCAA Football 2002, and it's here for the win.   The best of the best are
    here, with 117 Division 1-A and 27 1-AA teams represented in the game's
    roster, recreated with correct team stats, jerseys, and team-specific
    playbooks for the 1-A teams. The stadium spirit of college ball takes the
    game to another level with team mascots and arena cheers. Up in the booth is
    play-by-play and color commentary from the broadcast team of Brad Nessler,
    Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit. With special college-specific strategies,
    moves, and plays from the young upstarts in the sport, NCAA Football 2002
    plays quite differently from its NFL big-brother. The game also refuses to
    give an inch in the graphics department--the incredible detail and polish of
    Madden 2002 is here on the NCAA Football as well, with new realistic faces
    and uniforms and loads of college-specific details not seen anywhere else.
    With a complete Dynasty Mode for up to 12 players to take their team through
    decades of playing and the true test of the Campus Challenge that puts
    players in situations that will prove their greatness, NCAA Football 2002 is
    a game winner.

    battles. These high-speed, high-stake chase sequences push players to the
    limit as they fight off cops and opponents while whipping through traffic at
    180 miles per hour. An intelligent new A.I. mechanic delivers a realistic
    and high-energy action driving experience. Going back to the franchise's
    roots, Need for Speed Undercover features more aggressive and intelligent
    cops whose sole purpose is to take down the player quickly and by any means
    necessary. Need for Speed Undercover also features the series' signature car
    customization, real-world damage and realistic driving physics. The game
    includes some of the hottest licensed cars such as the Audi R8, BMW M6 and
    Lexus IS-F."

    football franchise to PlayStation 2 with NFL GameDay 2001. Obviously, the
    biggest change from past games in the series lies in the graphics, which
    have been greatly improved. The game features 1,100 position-specific
    tackles, jukes, spins, and stiff arms motion-captured from 13 pro NFL
    players. Grass and mud stains grace the players' jerseys, and photorealistic
    stadiums help to make for a more lifelike atmosphere.

    where you watch the player bend over his back, his muscles impacting hard on
    the glass as his faceshield sends a cracking noise reverberating throughout
    the stadium that makes an old lady up in the cheap seats cry just a little
    bit. That's what you want in a hockey game. That, and options - buckets full
    of options. Here, the hats hit the ice with all 30 franchise teams and 20
    international competitors, plus tournament and standard practice mode and
    charts packed with stats tracked throughout gameplay.

  description: Hundreds of new skating animations have been captured for NHL 2K7.
    Not only will skating look much more natural, players will also experience
    the true momentum of skating whenever players dig into the ice to accelerate
    or carve the ice to make sudden stops. In addition to the numerous new
    skating animations, several new checking, passing, and shooting animations
    have been added, making all the action in NHL 2K7 flow with amazing detail.
    New gameplay enhancements have been added to Pro Control, giving users
    offensive and defensive tools to utilize on the ice. While on offense,
    players now have the ability to execute drop passes, allowing users to setup
    new screen plays and create new scoring opportunities to catch the goalie
    off-guard. Pressure Control brings a tactical element to defensive hockey as
    players now can instruct teammates to defend opposing players while on the
    ice. Varying degrees of pressure can be selected - whether it's telling your
    teammate to shadow a selected opponent or deliver a big check - allowing
    players new defensive options on the fly. Pro Control in NHL 2K7 delivers
    the offensive and defensive options hockey fans have been asking for, truly
    delivering the next generation of hockey.

  description: Tokyo-23 is a land in turmoil. Each of the 23 districts has its own
    leader hoping to unify Tokyo-23 under one rule. Some do so for peace and
    justice, while some do so for their own personal gain. The Red Lance Corps
    of Minato Area are a team of schoolgirl warriors led by a charismatic young
    leader, whom they simply call "Master". Together, they must fight to unite
    Tokyo-23, but obviously that is easier said than done. NUGA-CEL! is a
    light-hearted simulation RPG set in a fantasy version of modern-day Tokyo.
    The player, as the unseen Master, must assemble a team of female fighters,
    dress them up in super-powered cosplay outfits, and lead them into battle to
    unify all of Tokyo-23. The game is divided into days, during which the
    player can manage their territories and team members, shop for and create
    new outfits, and either enter a dungeon or attack a neighboring territories.
    The available territories are often dictated by the story progression, and
    there are also various scenarios centering on the different characters in
    the player's team. The defining aspect of the game is its cosplay system.
    In-game battles are turn-based, up to 3-vs-3. Each character can be assigned
    an outfit, which each give them different skills and abilities, not to
    mention appearance. However, as characters take damage, so do their clothes,
    which will eventually be destroyed leaving them vulnerable. It is necessary
    to switch and repair outfits to keep characters in fighting shape. Outside
    of battle, the player can purchase items and outfits at shops, and there is
    also an extensive crafting system where new outfits and items can be
    produced.

    is a diety, there are naturally people who worship her and people who don't.
    The more people who worship her (as a result of her restoring color and
    doing other good deeds for them), the more powerful she becomes.

    between you and the princess so you'll need all your weapons and magic to
    break through. The world of Onimusha: Warlords comes alive with waterfalls,
    wind effects, insects and weather. But, in order to triumph, you must stay
    focused on your mission."

    a mortifying rain of bionic block patterns descending upon you, you race

    before they blow you to kingdom come. Your incentive to stay alive is the

    points to qualify, you'll charge into bonus games where it's you against the
    clock and the unstoppable blocks of QUARTH. So, ace, if you think you've got
    the steady hands of a brain surgeon, the sharp eye of an eagle, and the
    steely nerves of a Hollywood stuntman, power up QUARTH. And see if you can
    outlast the blockbusting action!

    - Pinball Hall of Fame - The Williams Collection
  description: 'Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection faithfully recreates
    eight of the most memorable tables from the golden age of pinball in
    photorealistic 3D. Working closely with Williams to ensure authenticity of
    each of the games, the collection is highlighted by some of the most popular
    and innovative Williams pinball tables, including Gorgar, the first-ever
    talking pinball machine, Black Knight, which introduced "Magna-Save" and
    Bonus Ball, and Space Shuttle, which took the pinball industry by storm in
    1984. Every table has been meticulously recreated to bring players the
    visuals, sound effects and gameplay that made these games legendary
    successes. Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection harkens back to the
    arcades of the 1980s. Players begin Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams
    Collection with access to four pinball tables, and the remaining four tables
    are unlocked as the game progresses. Players can spend as little as two
    minutes on a quick pinball challenge, or delve deeper into the game, gaining
    rewards in a token-based system as they unlock each of the pinball tables.
    Single-player Arcade and Challenge modes provide hours of solo
    entertainment, and a Multiplayer mode lets players face each other head-on.'

    villainy)...what's not to love about Captain Jack Sparrow? Jack Sparrow is
    the ultimate video game character - with his cocky swagger and his offbeat
    personality - and players are be able to experience his adventures first
    hand in this action game. Gamers slash and hack their way through a dozen
    locations, with fully interactive levels and varied gameplay. The action
    takes place in a variety of lush, immersive settings, including burning
    buildings, wrecked ships, and misty moonlit caves. The gameplay experience
    finds gamers fighting hordes of their enemies one minute, while in the next
    they're evading capture by the Royal Navy. Gamers learn new moves and combos
    as the game progresses, allowing even more spectacular, and deadly attacks
    during combat."

  description: In Police 24/7 instead of merely standing in one place and shooting
    enemies before you are shot, the game uses camera to determine a player's
    location; through this, the player is able to dodge around, duck to avoid
    bullets (and reload), and lean out to maximize cover and get a better shot.
    This is not foolproof, however; enemies will continue to shoot while the
    player is hiding, so it is possible to rise up and immediately get shot if
    the player is not careful. Also, like Time Crisis, the timer is continually
    running down, so one cannot hide for very long.

    the beach, sheltered under the palm trees, is a practice table where you can
    enhance your skills and watch the waves rolling in. When you feel you are
    good enough, you can enter the Competition Hut and start climbing the
    championship ladder. There are 11 sets of pool rules and 30 different
    computer opponents for you to challenge. It's not all over if you lose
    everything; there's a loan shark to lend you more cash--or bite your head
    off.

    Pinon PakaPuka is a white haired kid who would rather read and study than
    practice swordplay, go to school, or make friends. He is often compared to
    his father, Pietro, because everyone expects him to be as great as Pietro
    was when he was young, but Pinon hates the fact everyone is expecting too
    much from him. He meets the aqua haired girl named Luna after she saves him
    from drowning. Luna seems to know about Pinon, and Pinon doesn't know how."

    character who comes to a holy island to join Dragon Peace, a band of dragon
    riders who hope to make a move on the spirits' tower located on the island.

  description: PES 2008 features a brand new intelligence system, called
    Teamvision, that adapts and reacts to players own gameplay styles to ensure
    that the computer controlled opponents are always challenging and forcing
    the player to think and chance their style of play to avoid being
    out-thought by the game. It learns counter attacks that target your
    weaknesses and look to exploit any repetitive tactics players use. Defenders
    react better to danger, closing down the ball and charging at shots and the
    goalkeepers hold shots that are closer to them as well. Teammates make more
    intelligent runs into space and the close control has been sharpened to
    ensure quick and fluid passing and speedy attacks can be built. The next gen
    versions also feature extensive edit modes so players can completely
    customise their PES 2008 experience.

  description: Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 centers everything on the ball including
    how it moves and how players use it. First touch and sublime control are
    what set certain players apart from others. The ability to not only read a
    pass, but to be one step ahead and to know what is needed to gain yards on
    an encroaching defender. Trueball Tech allows the player to trap or knock on
    a pass using the analogue stick with detailed bar-centric physics
    determining the weight shift of the player and the height and speed of the
    pass, as to how the player's body will automatically shape to receive it.
    The Pro Evolution Soccer series has long since treated the ball as an
    individual entity, allowing the player huge amounts of freedom to pass into
    space, run on to a knocked-on counter, or produces short triangular passes
    to make space. Trueball Tech adds even more freedom, with full 360-degree
    control within several yards around the player and the ability to shield the
    ball from opposing players, use deft controls to wrong-foot them, and
    intuitive methods to master close control.

  description: "In Ratchet: Deadlocked, Ratchet and Clank are captured and forced
    to compete on an underground reality combat sport show. The show, which
    features abducted heroes fighting for their lives against a gruesome gang of
    deadly Exterminators, is run by a deranged media mogul named Gleeman Vox,
    who intends to use Ratchet and Clank as his next contestants. It doesn't
    take Vox long to realize that Ratchet is the most promising contestant the
    show has ever seen. Vox subjects our hero to a series of deadly battles and
    elaborate games of death, much to the delight of the show's enormous
    audience. To keep himself and his friends alive, Ratchet has no choice but
    to participate in the games and keep driving up the show's ratings with
    spectacular victories -- at least until our heroes can figure out a way to
    break free from Vox's control, the explosive Deadlock collar fastened to his
    neck, and bring the mighty Vox Network crashing down. Ratchet: Deadlocked
    features non-linear gameplay, allowing players greater freedom to choose
    their missions. In addition, all single-player levels will be available for
    multiplayer use. With much of the combat taking place in battlefields and
    arenas, gameplay will be more sports-oriented and will include announcer
    commentary. Featuring a new mission-structure approach, players will be
    rewarded with a constant progression of items such as weapons, armor and
    health. Players can take advantage of the new co-op gameplay functionality
    available throughout the game by choosing either single-player or
    multiplayer story mode. In addition, squad-based gameplay will enable
    players to demolish the competition by commandeering their allied combat
    bots through critical and strategic battles."

  description: "Reservoir Dogs is based on the 1992 Quentin Tarantino-directed
    classic movie about five total strangers who are brought together to carry
    out a diamond heist. The robbery goes wrong when the alarm is tripped and
    the cops show up. In the ensuing confusion, four of the robbers make it back
    to their warehouse rendezvous but it is quickly apparent that one of them is
    an undercover police officer - but which one? Staying true to the original
    plot, this intense, third person shooter follows the progress and planning
    of the famed diamond heist while filling in some of the cliffhanger
    questions from the film: What happened to Mr. Blue and Mr. Brown? Where did
    Mr. Pink hide the diamonds? What actually happened at the heist? These
    questions and more will be answered as the game unfolds and according to the
    player's tactics. Players get to fill the shoes of each iconic character in
    the film as they relive the Reservoir Dogs experience complete with the
    movie's trademark style and wit. The game will also feature the full and
    original soundtrack from the movie - the super sounds of the seventies
    brought alive with the thematic \"Little Green Bag\", \"Stuck in the Middle
    with You\" and more."

  description: Sakura Wars is a Strategy RPG that features a unique sim-based
    story system. An in-depth storyline exists, much like in any other RPG;
    however, the player's destiny in the game is not predetermined. Character
    interaction plays a major role, and your responses to the various characters
    in the game can ultimately change the story content and even the final
    outcome. The battle system is divided into two main parts; ground combat and
    air combat. Ground combat takes place using two-legged mechanized suits,
    which transform into jet fighters to take the fight to the sky. Every mech
    unit in the game can transform from battle mech mode to jet fighter mode
    during combat. Once transformed, weapons and movement methods will change as
    well. For example, the hero's ground mode utilizes a sword as his main
    weapon, but in jet mode he will use long-range missiles.

  description: Samurai Champloo steps out of the hack-and-slash action genre and
    offers a new way to swing a finely-honed samurai blade. Set in Japan with
    hip hop feel from the hit TV series by the same name, this title allows
    gamers to breathe life to a "lost episode" as one of three playable
    characters - Mugen, a reckless samurai with break-dancing fighting style,
    calculated Jin who abides by the decorum of Bushido, and a mysterious new
    character exclusive to the video game. Stranded in northern land of Ezo
    (current day Hokkaido) in search of the samurai who smells of sunflowers,
    the player must face foreign mercenaries, master swordsmen, diabolical
    assassins, mythical beasts, and gangster monkeys. The core of the game's
    unique combat system lies in the innovative integration of music and linked
    attacks. The players can choose an array of combos based on the different
    hip hop grooves that they can swap at will. Music tracks become collectible,
    opening an extensive assortment of linked attacks that can be implemented
    tactically during combat.

    Ancestors of the displaced Samurai call him Jack and help him through four
    enemy-filled realms with 24 interactive levels. Samurai Jack suffers various
    states of damage if he fails to dodge fireballs and sword strikes, but
    slow-motion attacks, devastating combo moves, and sushi snacks empower the
    hearty warrior. From a burning village to the bustling Aku City, you'll
    guide Jack as he blasts through doors, finds hidden pathways, and frees
    caged locals, bringing him ever closer to fulfilling his great destiny--the

    Nirvana, a land that can only be reached by the champions of Junkyard. They
    devote themselves to fighting against the never-ending resistance mustered
    by other tribes. In the midst of chaos, a mysterious object, the Pod,
    suddenly appears. Countless spheres of light are emitted by the Pod and
    infect Serf and his comrades, awakening their demonic powers. An
    unimaginable battle unfolds within their faint conscience. They develop a
    desire to tear the flesh and shatter the bones of their enemies, who have
    also been transformed. Their instincts tell them to devour every being in
    their path. Until then, Serf and his comrades only knew of battle, but for
    the first time, they experience new emotions. At that time, a dark-haired
    girl, Sera, comes to their rescue. Although she does not know where she came
    from, she holds a strange power - the power to control the party's demonic
    transformation. They receive orders from the Church of Karma to head for
    Nirvana, and they are accompanied by the dark-haired girl. "They who reach
    Nirvana first shall be recognized as the champions of Junkyard." The
    struggle intensifies, and they discover that the girl holds a key to the
    mystery. But, true fear still awaits Serf's party. Including Embryon, the
    tribe that the main character leads, several groups are at war with each
    other in order to survive. "Devour" your enemies and absorb their
    devastating powers and special abilities!

  description: "In Persona 3, the player takes the role of a male high-school
    student who joins the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad (SEES), a
    group of students investigating the Dark Hour, a time period between one day
    and the next that few people are aware of. During the Dark Hour, the player
    enters Tartarus, a large tower containing Shadows, creatures that feed on
    the minds of humans. To fight the Shadows, each member of SEES is able to
    summon a Persona, a manifestation of a person's inner self. The game's most
    iconic feature is the method by which the members of SEES release their
    Personas: by firing a gun-like object called an Evoker at their head. In
    addition to the standard elements of role-playing games, Persona 3 includes
    elements of simulation games, as the game's protagonist progresses day by
    day through a school year, making friends and forming relationships that
    improve the strength of his Personas in battle."

    from the old age, “Black Tower” that they live in, and the people that
    gather around them. The main character Domino became the 9th great wizard of
    the Grimoire Academy. It was a very special case for a young wizard to be so
    successful, but Domino soon grew tired of the Grimoire. The other great
    wizards were only seeing magic as means for personal success than an
    important research. The research of magic has been put off and all they were
    doing was fighting over authority. Domino left the capital and decided to
    live by himself in the sealed Black Tower on the frontier, rumored that a
    great wizard in the Age of Tower lived. But the other great wizards didn’t
    think well of that and gave him a test. That test was to “Raise a full
    fledged wizard within three years”. Normally it would take decades to raise
    a proper wizard. On top of that, the two students that he was suppose to
    look after, Aria Vancliff and Kaya Xavier, were two of the most troublesome
    girls in the academy. Will Domino be able to complete this difficult task.

    player must ration food for each of their companions -- all of them girls
    from the protagonist's school -- then choose a partner to go out and search
    for supplies and information, while doing their best to avoid or fight off
    the spirits haunting the ruins. Each character needs a certain amount of
    food each day; if they have too little, their health will deplete until they
    are incapacitated and eventually die. Investigation is command based, with
    the options to move to other locations, investigate the current area more
    closely, or converse with the player's current partner.

    International Treaty. <br/>With your characters working under the service of
    the Imperial Army, some 100 years after the last Great War, you must fight

    the 'fascist East Asian Army'.<br/>The game provides the option of playing
    with a second player for co-op play in both mission mode and story mode
    respectively. You can also acquire Soul orbs which act as a 'currency' of
    sorts to allow acquiring additional moves for your character including a
    major special attack (at a high fee, of course); there's also the option of
    upgrading character attributes such as Health, Strength, Speed, etc.
    <br/>There are about ten levels in story mode and about 100 in mission mode
    - the latter of which is unlockable as you play through the game.

    short, short skirt. She blasts away at goons in her stocking-accessorized,

    hallways in nothing but a bikini, with no mini-skirt on at all! "

  description: Motown is 50 years old this year, and to celebrate, Sony
    Corporation have released a version of the popular karaoke series entitled
    Singstar Motown. Founded in 1959, Motown established itself as a musical
    force that changed the American way of life for many music fans.  This
    phenomena,  which re-arranged, and fused both pop and soul, came at a time
    when the civil rights movement was at its peak. Motown spawned many great
    acts including The Temptations, The Four Tops, The Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder,
    Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, Diana Ross and the Supremes, Gladys Knight,
    and many, many more.

    - Sitting Ducks
  description: Welcome to the world of Sitting Ducks, where life is good, food is
    plentiful, and alligators are lurking in the neighboring Swampwood. You can
    play as one alligator, Aldo, and his friend, Bill the Duck, as they take on
    a variety of challenges. In more than 20 different missions, you'll do
    everything from racing Vespa scooters and ice-skating to playing soccer and
    water polo. With each event, crowds of ducks (each duck with its own
    personality) may form around you--but try not to become nervous.

    blistering graphics. The full power of the PlayStation 2 is on show in
    60-frames-per-second motion with motion-captured players animated down to

    positions for soccer action right out of broadcast TV. 18 International
    teams and 32 American squads line up and shoot hard with bicycle kicks,
    fakes, and headers. Soccer America features a balanced Easy Play mode to let
    beginners get into the game, while pro fielders will find the sharp AI more
    responsive to your fancy moves on the turf than the average soccer sim. With
    a Multi-Tap (for PlayStation 2), up to four players can call their

    at criminals with his .357 Magnum--but don't go thinking this will be a joy
    ride.  If your driving and shooting skills can't keep the TV audience on the
    edge of their sofas, your ratings will plummet, the show will be cancelled,
    and it's "game over."  Don't think you can handle all the high-speed thrills
    by yourself?  Find a partner and let them shoot while you drive.

    Will Vanilla join the Garland Globetrotters? Or, will he join the Killer

    domination, and it is opposed by the Allied Forces. In a desperate effort to
    reverse the highly unfavourable war situation they are in, the Allied Forces
    develop a highly advanced submarine called the Chronos, a vessel capable of
    great manoeuvrability and prowess in underwater combat. This new submarine
    is provided to a crew of mercenaries who have volunteered to fight in

  description: Surrounded in beautiful scenery, you must master hardcore surfing
    techniques to handle epic waves. As real as you can get...without getting
    wet.  Before the present 128-bit days, surfing was limited to crude,
    two-dimensional mock-ups of the real thing. Because of the complex nature of
    water, a powerful system is needed to accurately render the oceanic
    environs. With the powerful capabilities of the PlayStation 2, Take 2's
    Surfing H30 ups the level of surfing games with its visual splendor and
    water physics. With six different locales full of sun and surf, 11
    characters to ride the waves (all with their separate strengths and
    weaknesses), and a custom X-Board controller to more accurately reproduce
    the action with your Dual Shock 2, Surfing H30 aims to be the closest thing
    to surfing short of waxing up your own board and hitting the beach.

    that it is entirely dedicated to the art and it does its best to emulate
    what it's really like to take your life in your own hands. After all, one
    wrong move in a sword fight and you're six feet deep. As a spin-off to the
    Bushido Blade franchise, the first Kengo for the PlayStation 2 was rife with
    realism, but short on technical merits. For Kengo 2: Bushido Master, the
    same simulation-styled gameplay has returned for another go, which may end
    up disappointing fans of the series."

    the latest in high-tech weaponry, Logan and his team perform surgical strike
    missions - too sensitive for a military response, too dangerous for civilian
    intelligence forces. Through the role of Gabe, players will have to be quick
    to strategize, as he is responsible to infiltrate, recon and execute
    decisively. Once inserted, Logan is his own authority - he must make life
    and death decisions, quickly choosing which course of action to take.

  description: "Tales of Destiny for the PS2 is an updated remake of the PSX game
    of the same name. Taking place in a fantasy world, the game follows the
    story of a young man named Stahn who comes across a sentient sword named
    Dymlos and his subsequent encounters with other similar sword-wielders.
    Eventually, he and his friends must unite against evil forces seeking use a
    relic from an ancient war. The story of the game begins when
    country-boy-turned-adventurer Stahn Aileron, who seeks fame and adventure,
    sneaks aboard the flying ship Draconis as a stowaway. He is found out by the
    crew and forced to work as a deckhand, but when a large hostile force
    attacks the ship, the crew is overwhelmed and Stahn breaks free during the
    ensuing chaos. Looking for a usable weapon to fend off the attackers, he
    gains access to a storeroom and discovers a \"junk\" sword. However, the
    sword starts talking to him, calling itself Dymlos and claiming to be a
    sentient Swordian from the Aeth'er Wars. Armed with Dymlos, Stahn fights his
    way to an escape pod, which he uses to escape the rapidly descending ship
    before it crashes into the ground. Dymlos becomes the key to the fame,
    fortune, and adventure Stahn seeks as the young man meets other Swordians,
    quickly becoming embroiled in a battle for a relic of the Aeth'er Wars: a
    huge, extremely powerful Lens called the Eye of Atamoni. "

  description: TMNT3 puts more of a focus on teamwork, character development and
    control than any other console Turtles game to date. Gamers can play as
    their favorite Turtle alone or with up to three friends, earning experience
    points along the way as they slash and bash Foot Ninjas and powerful,
    well-known bosses from the TMNT universe. These experience points allow
    players to improve and evolve their Turtles' traits and abilities for more
    varied, powerful attacks and moves. The Ninja Scroll System is another new
    feature on TMMT3. Being able to select which ninja scrolls to use allows the
    Turtles to use various special abilities strategically. Cooperative play
    lies at the heart of TMNT3 and gamers who team up with friends for
    multiplayer action are rewarded with exclusive features such as Cooperative
    Attack for even more shell shocking damage to enemies. The effect of this
    attack changes depending on the number of players working together (between
    2-4 players). For even greater control, TMNT3 features a new combat system
    called the Target Attack system that lets gamers play more instinctively and
    strategically. With the Target Attack system, players will be able to lock
    onto specific enemies and block, dodge or counter attack accordingly for
    smoother and more maneuverable combat. Story Mode can be played with 1-4
    players. Even when you have less than 4 players to play, the other Turtles
    will be at your side, controlled through AI. All the Turtles can participate
    in Cooperative Attack to beat enemies and players can give commands to the
    AI.

    Azuma clan, served Lord Gohda by returning his precious daughter, Kiku, from
    the hands of Lord Mei-Oh. Unfortunately, Rikimaru was caught in a disastrous
    rockfall during his escape, in an attempt to save Ayame and Kiku, and is
    still missing. The land of Gohda remained peaceful after Mei-Oh's attack,
    and Ayame, as an agent of Gohda, continued to patrol the expansive
    territory.One day in her travels, Ayame came across a destroyed ninja
    village. She hoped to find survivors, but arrived too late. The ninja of
    Hagakure died whispering the "Kuroya" with their final breaths. As Ayame was
    about to leave, a young female ninja stood in her way. Her name was Rin,
    back from her training, and devastated to see her village in ruins. She sees
    Ayame as the only person alive, and blames her for the destroying of her
    village. Eventually, Rin sees that it was not Ayame that destroyed her
    village. The two team up to find the people responsible.

    Marl games, Tenshi no Present uses 3D backgrounds with 2D character sprites.
    Tenshi no Present, unlike the earlier games in the series, consists of six
    separate chapters, each of which features different characters from the Marl
    Kingdom series. The chapters take place in various times before or after the
    stories of Rhapsody and Little Princess. These chapters often address
    unanswered questions from the earlier games, or provide additional insight
    into the characters. Tenshi no Present is a typical RPG, complete with
    experience points, parties of characters, and spell casting. In each
    chapter, the player guides different characters through their adventure,
    engaging in several battles along the way. "

    their new pets and add more fun to the Sims experience. From dogs, cats,
    caged animals and more, your Sims share new friends to experience life's
    precious moments. With so many different animals to choose from, there's no
    telling what unpredictable experiences could occur. Create-A-Pet: Choose
    from dozens of dog and cat breeds or customize features for a one-of-a-kind
    pet. You can even modify your pet's body shape by choosing from specific
    colors and unique markings. Don't like the way they act? Change their
    personality - from smart and sweet to silly and sloppy - anyone can create
    their ideal animal friend in The Sims 2 Pets. Your Sims can encourage and
    discipline pets, training them to shake, roll over, play dead, and more.
    Unruly pets might dig in the yard, claw the sofa, or topple the trash.
    Thankfully, a little training can go a long way. Create and control digital
    characters over a lifetime, setting their goals in life from popularity and
    romance, to fortune and family- their stories are in your hands. Use special
    codes to share unlockable pet accessories, fur types or markings with other
    The Sims 2 Pets players. Take your Sims and their pet for a romp at any of
    the nearby park areas, or head to the Central Town Park which is a favorite
    of pet owners. While there, watch your pet play well with others while your
    Sim can meet others and socialize with fellow animal lovers. Visit the
    adjoining Town Center, a great gathering spot for Sims that evolves over
    time. Once you've seen the latest styles and decided on a purchase, deck
    your pet out in the latest clothing and accessories around. From geek to
    chic and cool to casual, your Sim can customize their pet's look with one
    stop in the Town Center."

    used in other coaster games. Rather, Thrillville's easy to use building mode
    has been designed specifically for the console platforms and makes building
    all 75-plus rides from wooden, corkscrew and inverted coasters to merry go
    rounds, trains and carnival rides, easy, and most importantly, fun.
    Imagination is the only height limit with Thrillville, where the fun ranges
    from racing on go-kart tracks you put together and playing mini-golf on
    courses you designed to joining friends for dozens of four-player party
    games, from bumper cars to arcade shoot-'em-ups. You can also tour the park
    on foot - a first for theme-park titles - chatting and joking with all the
    guests to help them out and make sure they're enjoying themselves.

    Arts in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2001. In all, six pro golfers take to the green
    on three real-life courses including SpyGlass Hill, Pebble Beach, and Poppy
    Hills as they swing and putt their way through exact replicas of all 18
    holes. The varied modes of play are now supported by two new entries,
    Challenge and Play-Now, in addition to such returning staples as Match,
    Skins, and Stroke. Making use of the PS2's additional graphical capacity
    over its PS1 counterpart, the game also boasts fully-rendered 3D
    environments and players, as well as an enhanced analog control system that
    makes use of the PlayStation's Dual Shock 2 enhancements.

    Although each is unaware of the others, they all share an ageless common
    spirit of adventure - but unknown to them, their daring actions have
    attracted the attention of the TimeSplitters.   The TimeSplitters - an evil
    race dwelling outside of time and space. For eons they have manipulated the
    fate of humanity for their own malign ends - with cursed shards of crystal
    they have sown fear, greed and conflict throughout history. Now, roused from
    an ancient sleep, the TimeSplitters cross the threshold from their shadowy
    dimension - ripping through the fabric of time itself to confront our
    heroes.  Can our heroes unite against a common enemy to realize a greater
    destiny? Or will humanity be consigned forever to a realm ruled under the
    shadow of the TIMESPLITTERS?

  description: "Based on the 2007 live-action feature film, Transformers: The Game
    lets gamers control the outcome in the battle for Earth as they choose to
    protect it as Autobots or destroy it as Decepticons. The game is mainly a
    third-person action-shooter. All the robots have at least five attack types:
    a light weapon, a heavy weapon, a melee attack, and the ability to throw
    objects such as cars, lamp posts, trees, etc., and using a long object like
    a lamp post as a sword. As its title and characters imply, a robot can
    transform into a vehicle and vice versa, this gives the game some racing
    elements, as the player must, in some missions, race to certain point within
    a time limit or before a character of the opposing faction does. Each area
    is an open world environment, and there are also side-missions, Energon
    cubes and Autobot/Decepticon emblems scattered through the city, if
    accomplished successfully/collected the player can unlock trailers,
    production photos and unlock color schemes for certain characters."

    - Triple Play Baseball
  description: With a winning history on PCs and other consoles, Triple Play
    Baseball now signs up to another big league gaming platform on the
    PlayStation 2. The move gives Triple Play another leap in realism, from the
    ultra-sharp graphics with real player faces and stadiums to the advanced AI
    that enables more realistic and flexible gameplay. The DUALSHOCK 2
    controller's analog features are now a key element of the batting, pitching,
    and fielding control for a truer sports gaming experience. To get the game
    right, EA once again turned to the pros--American League MVP Jason Giambi of
    the Oakland A's and National League Manager of the Year Dusty Baker of the
    S.F. Giants lent their expertise on how to play hardball in the majors. Of
    course, in baseball, what it all boils down to is the showdown at the
    plate--the pitcher facing off against the batter for all the money. Triple
    Play Baseball again refines the game with a power zone/contact zone batting
    cursor--power hitters may have a tiny cursor, but it's all power zone, while
    more dependable sluggers will have a larger cursor but may have a smaller
    sweet spot. Batters are going to need all that control if they're hoping to
    tee off the pitching this year, which is also improved in control to give
    them every trick in the books. Players' skills are accurately based on
    player stats from last season, so if you see Mark McGwire at the plate or
    Randy Johnson on the mound, expect some bad things to go down.

    who has been hired by one of the city's dominant gangs to protect its

    corruption and street justice that spans from the neighborhood block all the
    way to the upper levels of city government. Urban Reign offers players
    non-stop, inner-city brawling action with no time restrictions or referees.
    Back alleys, junkyards and bars serve as battlegrounds for more than 60
    different fighters, all of which boast their own unique set of fighting
    styles including boxing, wrestling and street fighting. Players can select
    from over 30 weapons - including bottles, bats and 2x4's - to be used in the
    destructible arenas to add to the mayhem. Focusing on the urban-brawler
    style of street fighting, players can team up with an AI-controlled
    character to pull off a host of devastating and destructive combo maneuvers
    against multiple enemies throughout the game's 100 missions. Urban Reign
    also supports multi-tap play for up to four players to determine who really
    rules the hood.

  description: Hundreds of years before Lenneth's tale, another saga lies
    concealed by the gods. The valkyrie Silmeria once served Odin loyally, but
    after an incident ignited a conflict between them, Odin forcefully
    reincarnated her as a human. The human soul that would carry her spirit was
    that of Alicia, Princess of Dipan. Ordinarily, Silmeria-s consciousness
    would have been sealed, her spirit dormant until she was next summoned...
    However, the forced transmigration causes Silmeria's spirit to awaken within
    Alicia, leaving two souls to inhabit a single body. The spirit that should
    have been sealed has awakened-a situation Odin will not ignore for long.
    This installment introduces the new Photon Action System to the classic
    side-scrolling action format found in the original. Projecting photons
    grants players more freedom to explore and expands the action, resulting in
    challenging puzzles with clever solutions. Add to that "sealstones" that
    affect the laws of nature in dungeons, launching strategy to new heights.
    The unique battle system of the previous game has evolved into the Advanced
    Tactical Combination Battle System.

    characters" &mdash; hidden within each image that the player must reveal by
    jumping on them. Taking from Vib Ribbon's ability to generate new levels
    using music the player provides on CD, Vib Ripple instead allows the player
    to create new levels by importing photos from USB camera, though an already
    wide variety of images are included in the game itself.

    new characters vying for a shot at winning the Worldwide Martial Arts
    Championship II Tournament are Goh, a trained assassin, and Brad, an Italian
    Muay Thai champion kickboxer. Once you make a name for yourself through a
    series of simulated arcade tournaments amid snow, rain, and sand, you'll
    qualify for the biggest fight of your career and show the world what you're
    really made of.

  description: Jude Maverick has grown up in an isolated town called Ciel, which
    is completely enclosed in a large sphere floating thousands of feet above
    the surface of Filgaia. His sheltered world changes forever when he sees the
    sky "tear" and ships entering his homeland. Upon inspecting the camp site
    set up by the intruders, he sees something that he has never seen before; a
    girl. The girl's name is Yulie and she is being held captive by the
    intruders after being captured by a "Drifter" for hire, Arnaud G. Vasquez.
    After the invading army attacks Ciel and brings the whole sphere crashing
    down, Jude, Yulie and Arnaud join forces to find out the army's true
    intention behind Yulie's abduction. With the help of another Drifter,
    Raquel, these four idealistic teenagers travel the war-torn land of Filgaia
    in search of truth, their own identities and their individual paths to
    adulthood. Innovative new HEX battle system unlike anything seen before in
    turn-based RPGs; easily accessible while providing an amazing amount of
    speed, depth and strategy. Action elements on the field map such as double-
    jumps, using the new "Accelerator" ability to manipulate time, and equipping
    items to solve puzzles maintains the excitement between battles.

  description: WILD ARMS 5 follows the journey of a group of young travelers as
    they try to unlock the mysteries of their ravaged land and unknowingly
    become involved in a struggle that will decide the fate of the entire world.
    In a small town called Capo Bronco on the outskirts of Filgaia, two youths,
    Dean Stark and Rebecca Streisand, witness an unbelievable event -- the giant
    arm of a golem somehow falling from the sky, clutching a girl named Avril.
    This chance encounter inspires Dean and Rebecca to travel with Avril across
    the wastelands of Filgaia in hopes of helping her regain her lost memories
    and embark on a journey that will eventually decide the fate of all mankind.

    characters--Emma, Jane, and McDullen. Dungeons include plenty of new traps
    and monsters to foil you in your quest, but your characters have helpful
    abilities, ranging from the traditional (running, picking up objects, and
    leaping) to the stealthy (sneaking and observing), to help them through
    sticky situations."

  description: When the creators of eye-candy-laden PC hits Expendable and
    Incoming start working on a racing game, it's a pretty sure bet that it will
    boast some rather impressive effects. While Wild Wild Racing may not turn
    heads in the same way Gran Turismo 3 does, it does look good; and if there's
    one thing the UK developers like Rage Software are known for, it's creating
    a solid racing experience. Picked up from Japanese publisher Imagineer by
    Interplay, Wild Wild Racing has since seen overhauls in the physics,
    control, and speed. Gamers can ride in nine different vehicles, and race in
    several global locations during different hours of the day such as night,
    dusk, and the late afternoon. The game boasts a solid 60 frames per second,
    and the over-the-top effects that Rage is known for. Control is all analog,
    meaning even the D-pad (as well as the traditional analog buttons) responds
    to pressure; the harder you press, the sharper the turn and the faster the
    acceleration and braking.

  description: In a world where terror takes many forms, a new weapon threatens to
    shake the balance of power. Freedom's last hope rests in the hands of three
    new operatives, who must race against time to recover this doomsday device.
    The fate of the world hangs by a thread, and a few ticks of the clock means
    the difference between justice and annihilation. WINBACK 2 brings to the
    series a new "route" system that lets players experience each mission from
    the perspective of different operatives. There are 30 intense missions,
    multiple difficulty levels, and new weapons including the highly-anticipated
    sniper rifle. The new Winback assault team is comprised of three young, yet
    combat-proven operatives led by Craig Contrell. Each team member is
    qualified in six different weapon types and highly-adept at CQB (Close
    Quarter Battle). They are masters of target identification, engagement and
    shot placement. In the hands of the player, all of these techniques will be
    put to the test. The game's unique shooting action is spread across 30
    high-risk operations situated in challenging urban environments and
    conveyances.

    stop it. You are Jean-Luc Couger, a special operative for the government's
    Strategic Covert Actions Team. As the terrorists count down to a second
    attack, you must duck, sneak, and crawl through enemy-infested environments.
    And when the situation calls for a more aggressive approach, you'll have a
    wide variety of weapons to choose from.

    - Without Warning
  description: In Without Warning, a radical terrorist group has targeted and
    seized the Peterson-Daniels Chemical Facility, a vulnerable location that
    jeopardizes millions of people from the devastating ecological hazard it
    imposes if destroyed. Pleas are useless and any direct military assault
    would be too great a risk. As terrified hostages fearfor their lives, their
    only hope lies with a covert operations team, whose goal is to infiltrate
    the plant and eliminate the merciless enemy. The harrowing events unfold
    over a 12 hour period, featuring a unique gameplay dynamic which enables the
    six central characters to experience events across the same timeline but
    from their own distinct viewpoints. The player controls each character
    individually, with the focus automatically shifting to a new character at
    key moments which are unfolded throughcut scenes. By switching between the
    characters, their individual tales are woven together to create an overall
    picture of the events that happened during the crisis. The player will also
    retrospectively view events through the eyes of another character and is
    therefore not only a participant in the events, but a spectator as well.
    Furthermore, actions performed as one character affect the progress of
    others and players must successfully utilize the strengths of each in order
    to advance.

  description: "Here's the deal with skateboarding: if you can't throw down your
    own tricks, you might as well either let your jaw drop or take off when real
    skaters are putting on a show. Be cool about it. But scratch that, these
    little ghostly hosers called Gawoo are getting all up on the city and trying
    to take it over. They ain't cool, and why? Because they can't skate. They're
    skater-haters, just like the rest of these street peds. But they still get
    wowed when you bust out boarding moves like a breakdancer, and that's the
    whole deal with Yanya Caballista: City Skater. Koei's new skating game is
    one part wacky Japanese-styled insanity, then another few thousand parts
    more wacky Japanese-styled insanity for some of the most bizarre and funky
    graphic design explosions on the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment
    system. Skate the city collecting cash and other goodies to boost your trick
    bag, then go after the Gawoo and drive them off the block. Show some fierce
    moves, and they'll take off running from your godly skills. Yanya Caballista
    even comes with a giddy little gaming trinket--a fingerboard for pulling off
    your own ollies and aggro moves."

  description: You are Sayori, a more-or-less ordinary high school student who is
    spending her summer vacation helping at an archaeological excavation. One
    day in the ruins, you happen to notice something shining half-buried in the
    mud. When you look more closely, you realize it is a pendant, and you pick
    it up... And thus the story begins.  That night, a girl appears to you in a
    dream, begging you to save her. She is Hatsuhime, princess of the Mochizuki
    clan and she was murdered a hundred and fifty years ago. The pendant that
    you found is the only thing she left behind. Next morning, you wake up in a
    place you have never been before - a place that still feels strangely
    familiar. You are living in Hatsuhime's time, in Hatsuhime's castle, in
    Hatsuhime's body, and it is your job to save her from her tragic destiny. It
    seems impossible - until you meet a group of wandering samurais, Yo, Jin and
    Bo.
